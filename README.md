# Cyborg Discord Bot
The source code for the verified discord bot, Cyborg (owned by me.)

So first, here's a description of the gtn commands.
-gtn: Starts the game of Guess The Number, you have to put 2 numbers for the bot to randomly choose from (example: i do -gtn 1 1000, it will pick a random number from 1 - 1000.)
-disablegtn: Ends the Guess The Number game.
-gtnStats: Server/User stats of Guess The Number
-gtnNumber: Tells you the Guess The Number number that users are trying to guess. Helps with hints!
This is it, thank you so much and hope you enjoy me! <33

Do not forget to put the package.json code, it will not work without it.
