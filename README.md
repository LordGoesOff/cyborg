# UPDATE [2024-05-14] - Deprecated

The code for this has been extremely outdated for quite some time now, as this is from 2021. The package has changed a lot since then, so if you're interested in using this code, you will need to change a lot of things. Feel free to star if you use any of my code.

At 10 Stars, I'll update this code to make it more up-to-date.

# Cyborg Discord Bot
~~The source code for the verified discord bot, Cyborg (owned by me.)~~

~~So first, here's a description of the gtn commands.~~
~~-gtn: Starts the game of Guess The Number, you have to put 2 numbers for the bot to randomly choose from (example: i do -gtn 1 1000, it will pick a random number from 1 - 1000.)
-disablegtn: Ends the Guess The Number game.~~
~~-gtnStats: Server/User stats of Guess The Number
-gtnNumber: Tells you the Guess The Number number that users are trying to guess. Helps with hints!
This is it, thank you so much and hope you enjoy me! <33~~

~~Do not forget to put the package.json code, it will not work without it.~~

~~Credits are not needed.
